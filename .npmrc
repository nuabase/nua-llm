# inject-workspace-packages: Required for `pnpm deploy` in pnpm v10+
#
# By default, pnpm uses symlinks for workspace dependencies:
#   api-server/node_modules/nua-llm-core -> ../../../nua-llm-core (symlink)
#
# This is great for development (instant visibility of changes), but breaks
# `pnpm deploy` because symlinks point outside the deployable directory.
#
# With this setting, workspace dependencies are copied as real files:
#   api-server/node_modules/nua-llm-core/ (actual files)
#
# This allows `pnpm deploy` to create a standalone, self-contained output
# that can be copied into a Docker image without broken symlinks.
#
# Used by: api-server/Dockerfile (pnpm --filter api deploy)
